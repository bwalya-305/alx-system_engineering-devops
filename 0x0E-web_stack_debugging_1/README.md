# Web stack debugging #1

This project is a continuation in the Webstack debugging series. Web stack debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or performance issues in web applications that involve multiple components, such as servers, databases, frameworks, browsers, etc. Web stack debugging can be challenging because it requires understanding how different layers of the web stack interact with each other and how to use various tools and techniques to diagnose and resolve problems.
