# Web Server

For this project, we are taught how important and beneficial it is as a software engineer to automate our work. In this case, we will be automating the configuration of a web server that we have been given to work with.

In this project, I will be :

* Writing a bash script that allows me to transfer a file from my client computer to my server.
* Installing Nginx on my web server.
* Setting up my personal domain name.
* Configuring Nginx to do some redirections.
