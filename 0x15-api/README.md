# API

An API, or application programming interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary layer that processes data transfers between systems, letting companies open their application data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies.

A simple way to understand how APIs work is to think of them like a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each dish. When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurantâ€™s kitchen does the work and provides you with some finished dishes.

There are different types of APIs for different purposes, such as web APIs, which allow communication between computers that are joined by the internet,or hardware APIs, which allow software to interact with physical devices.

# REST API

A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.
A RESTful API allows for interaction with RESTful web services, which are web services that follow the REST principles. RESTful web services transfer a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This representation can be in one of several formats,such as JSON, XML, HTML, etc.

In this project, you will access employee data via an API to organize and export them to different data structures.
