#  SSH

## Description

This project was conducted in Alx School's Full Stack Software Engineering course. The goal is to learn what SSH is, how to create an SSH-RSA key pair, and how to use SSH to connect to remote hosts.

SSH is a secure protocol used as the primary means of connecting to Linux servers remotely. It provides a text-based interface by spawning a remote shell. After connecting, all commands you type in your local terminal are sent to the remote server and executed there. SSH stands for Secure Shell and provides a safe and secure way of executing commands, making changes, and configuring services remotely. When you connect through SSH, you log in using an account that exists on the remote server.
